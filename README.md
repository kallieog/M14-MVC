# M14-MVC

## Description
Having fun with MVC in the module 14 challenge. This website is a blog-style website where developers can publish posts and other developers can interact with them.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to be able to post to a public coding forum, so that I can learn more about coding from other developers.
